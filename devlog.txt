Created new branch "features/dev-downgrade-to-7" to downgrade to php 7.0 from 7.1. This was done due to a seg fault occurring when xdebug stepped into a autoload. Hopefully
this issue doesn't exist with php 7.1. The process to downgrade to 7.0 from 7.1 was to remove optional return values via : ?.

Confirmed. Debugging works properly in 7.0.
