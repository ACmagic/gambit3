# Gambit â€“ Local environment set-up

### Prep dev env

    Create directory ~/Workspace/vm/profile
    Create directory ~/Workspace/vm/box/gambit2
    Use http://puphpet.com to generate vagrant config from puphpet/config.yaml file.
    Download zip file to ~/Workspace/vm/profile and unzip and rename folder to gambit2.

    In console navigate to ~/Workspace/vm/profile/gambit2
    Run: vagrant up

    This will stand-up the box/environment.

    $ cd /var/www
    $ rm -Rf local.gambit
    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:oddz/gambit3.git local.gambit

    -- Connect to gambit database through ssh tunnel

    Add .env file (this can't be placed in version control for security reasons)

    $ bower install (this will be replaced with mix... (webpack) hopefully)

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
